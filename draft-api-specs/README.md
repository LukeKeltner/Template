# Draft API Specifications

> [!WARNING] 
> This repository is for the working group to use while drafting documentation and specifications before they are formally ratified.  Users outside of the working group **SHOULD NOT** begin implementing solutions based on the content in this repository as it is likely to change without notice.

The working group's draft OpenAPI specification is available in this directory.  Once the API specification has been reviewed and approved by the [Governance Committee](https://www.irionline.org/member-programs/operations-technology/committee-hub/governance/), it will be moved into the [Digital-First-Specifications](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Digital-First-Specifications) repository and published at [specs.dfa.irionline.org](https://specs.dfa.irionline.org).

Please refer to the [Digital-First-Specifications](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Digital-First-Specifications) repository for technical governance of standards, style guide, data dictionary, and the code of conduct.

# Version Numbering for Working Drafts

All API specification MUST use [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) version strings.

**Pre-ratification (no prior approved version exists)**: The major version MUST be 0. Working groups MAY freely increment minor and patch versions (e.g. `0.1.0`, `0.2.0`, `0.14.0`). A major version of 0 signals that no stability guarantees exist.

**Post-ratification (one or more approved versions exist)**: Once the API specification has been published in the [Digital-First-Specifications](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Digital-First-Specifications) repository,  proposed changes to the specification MUST select a target version number consistent with semver, for example:
* A breaking change to a ratified spec requires a major version bump
* Backward-compatible additions require a minor bump.
* Drafts in this repository MUST append a pre-release identifier to the target version using the form <target>-draft.<N> (e.g. `2.0.0-draft.1`). When a working group considers a draft ready for ratification, it SHOULD advance the suffix to -rc.<N> (e.g. `2.0.0-rc.1`). The clean version (no suffix) is reserved for the versions ratified by IRI and published to the [Digital-First-Specifications](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Digital-First-Specifications) repository.

**General rules**:
* Major versions MUST NOT be skipped (e.g. ratifying 3.0.0 requires a prior ratified 2.0.0).
* IRI will ratify the final version number. Working group target numbers are proposals; IRI MAY require a different version if the semver classification is incorrect (e.g. a breaking change labeled as minor).
* Multiple working drafts targeting different versions MAY coexist (e.g. a 1.1.0-draft.2 adding features alongside a 2.0.0-draft.1 introducing a breaking redesign).

# Standard Agent

The [Standard Agent](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Standard-Agent) repository provides an AI-assisted review tool to help working groups identify inconsistencies in their YAML files and data dictionaries before submission to the Governance Subcommittee. The goal is to surface most minor and major technical issues prior to human review.

**To run locally:**
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already present
2. Clone the Standard Agent repository
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Add your LLM API keys to a local `.env` file (see the Standard Agent README for the required format)
5. Start the local server

**Quick-start alternative:** Copy the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` from the repository from the repository [agent file](https://github.com/Insured-Retirement-Institute/Standard-Agent/blob/main/agent/agent_prod.py) directly into an LLM service of your choice for a lightweight, no-install review.
